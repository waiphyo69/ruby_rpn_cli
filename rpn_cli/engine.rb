  CHOOSE any number or any of four basic arithmic operators and PRESS enter
  PRESS
    'q' to quit
    'h' to view help
    's' to view current operand stack
    'r' to clear out and reset the stack

  - Operand stack is a set of numbers you have put in
    that have not been evaluated
  - Operand stack needs to have at least two numbers
    before putting an operator in
